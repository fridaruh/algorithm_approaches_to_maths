# Week 1: Assignment, logic, and functions


## Goals of this worksheet

- Introduction to basic Julia 
- Introduction to mathematical syntax and its' manipulation
- Mathematical sets and set operations
- Introduction to the type system in Julia
- Introduction to functions: injectivity, surjectivity and bijectivity



!!! info "First make sure you can..."
	- add your own code boxes by clicking the `+` sign on the left hand side of the screen. 
	- enable and hide visibility of the code box by clicking the eye on the top left corner of each code box.
	- convert a code box to text: type `md` followed by three quotation marks at the beginning of the box. add three quotation marks at the end of the box. EG see this box for an examplte

	**Try it**
	- use the *live docs* (bottom right) to help you see the definition of the code you are writing
	- modify and save the worksheet
	- Write maths using dollar signs and LaTeX syntax, e.g. by modifying the equation below. Notice the dollar signs have to be touching the maths...no spaces! Learning LaTeX syntax will be an ongoing exercise, **necessary for the exam**, over the next few weeks.
	$$x^2 + y^2 = \frac{a}{b} + \int_1^3 \gamma(t) \ dt$$
	- [detexify](https://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html) and [cheatsheet](https://quickref.me/latex.html) are your friends.
	- note that **comments** can be made in code blocks using the comment icon #. Comments don't affect the code. You will see commented code below.

## What to do:

- Go through the worksheet. Make sure you understand and can manipulate **every code block**. Read the comments in the code as well as the textboxes.
- Do the questions. 
- Add your own comments, explanations and code to the worksheet. Save it. It's yours now!

# Assignment

Think of the concept of a **noun** in English (or any other human language). It binds a word to a concept. For instance, when you read *Dhruva* (a proper noun), you might conceptualise me. When you read *person*, you might conceptualise the more abstract concept of an arbitrary human being.

When programming, we create our own nouns (others are already provided by the programming language). These are known as **variables**. They link an expressible, readable name (e.g. `x`) to a julia object (e.g. the `Float64` number: `1.0`).

### In programming
- Logical operators (see below) return a Boolean value: `true` or `false`
- see what happens to the code blocks in this section when you change x from 1 to another number (e.g. 3)

### In mathematics

- In mathematics we write expressions involving logical operators as well. For instance. [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_mathematical_symbols) is a comprehensive glossary.

Some important ones are:

| **Symbol**  | **Explanation**  |
|---|---|
| $$a \Rightarrow b$$  | a implies b   |
| $$a \Leftarrow b$$  | a is implied by b   |
| $$a \Leftrightarrow b$$  | a is equivalent to b   |
| $$a^c$$  | The negation (opposite) of a  |
| $$\therefore$$  | Therefore  |
| $a \land b$  | a and b  |
| $a \lor b$  | a or b  |
| $\forall$  | for all or for each  |
| $:$  | such that  |
| $\exists$ | there exists  |
| $\in$ | is a member of, e.g. $3 \in \mathbb{N}$  |
| $!$ | unique, e.g. $\exists! x \in \mathbb{N}: x > 3 \land x < 5$  |


!!! info "Question"
	1. Write the following out in English (see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_types_of_numbers) if you need):
	$$\exists! x \in \mathbb{N}: x > 3 \land x < 5$$
	2. Write the following in Maths:
	> For each integer $n$, there is a rational number $r$ such that $n \times r = 1$. 
	3. Is the above statement true?

!!! info "Answer"
	1. There exists a unique Natural number $x$ such that $x$ that is greater than 3 and less than 5.

	2. $\forall n \in \mathbb{Z}, \exists r \in \mathbb{Q} : n \times r = 1$

	3. The above statement is FALSE: It does not hold for $0 \in \mathbb{Z}$.

!!! info "Question"
	If $$a \Rightarrow b$$ then what is the relationship between $a^c$ and $b^c$?

md"""
!!! info "Answer"
	After modification, the cell's output changes from ```false``` to ```hi```.  This is because the ```&&``` operator has the short-circuit evaluation property.  Given a chain of ```&&```'s, julia will stop evaluation at the first ```false``` it encounters, without evaluating the other arguments.  Thus, ```x==2``` is originally false, and so it does not continue evaluating the expression.  However, when we change this to ```x==1```, julia evaluates the next argument, which in this case is a function all.  Hence, the output changes.

### If statements

```julia
if a 
	b
elseif c
	d
else e
end
```
- `a` and `c` must be booleans, i.e. they evaluate to `true` or `false`. 
- b gets evaluated if a is true
- you can add as many elseif blocks as you like.

!!! info "Question"

	What combination of booleans causes `d` to be run? Hint: it's not `c == true`

!!! info "Answer"

	We must have ```c == true``` AND ```a == false```.  If ```a == true```, we will simply output ```b``` and skip to end.

# Functions

- This is a basic introduction. For the more ambitious, read [this](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/functions/).

## Calling functions

- Some variables are known as **functions**. Some functions come pre-installed. Others, you will assign yourself.
- Functions **transform** variables. They have **inputs** and **outputs** which both consist of single/multiple variables.

```julia

function some_function(input1,input2) 
	# function body: write code here
	return output1, output2, output3
```
- Writing a function, as above, **does not run the code in the function body**. We first need to **call** the function... 
```julia
a = 1; b = 2
o1, o2, o3 = some_function(a,b) # inside the function body, a/b will be referred to as input1/input2 respectively
```
- As seen above, we append inputs in round brackets to the name of the function to call the function. This runs the function body code, with `input1=a` and `input2=b`.
- In the example above, the same julia objects ($1$ and $2$) are referred to as `a` and `b` in **global** scope (i.e. outside the function), and as `input1` and `input2` in **local scope** (inside the function body)

- The previously listed [operators](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/mathematical-operations/) are all functions. However, they are called in a special shorthand notation, for convenience. For instance, instead of writing:
```julia
+(x,y)
```
to add two numbers, we can write 
```julia 
x+y
```
...but you can use either notation!

# Sets and Types

## Sets

- A set is a collection of **things** (anything!). By default a set is **unordered**: there is no `first`, `second`, or `last` element of the set. 

In mathematics, some common sets (**which you should google now**) are:
-  $\mathbb{N}$: the natural numbers.
-  $\mathbb{Z}$: the integers. 
-  $\mathbb{Q}$: the rational numbers 
-  $\mathbb{R}$: the real numbers 
-  $\mathbb{C}$: the complex numbers 

!!! info "Notation" 
	-  $\subset$ means: "is a subset of"
	-  $\subseteq$ means "is a subset of, and may be the entire set"
	-  $\in$ means: is a member of
	-  $A\cup B$ means: the union of sets $A$ and $B$.

## Types 

- We've referred previously, and implicitly, to different types of Julia objects. Clearly, functions are not the same as integers, for instance. 

- There is an explicit classification scheme for different julia objects. This is known as the **type system**. 

- A good analogy is phylogenetic trees in Biology. Just as:

> Homo sapiens <- Homo <- Hominidae <- Primates <- Mammalia <- Chordata <- Animalia

we have 

> `Int64 <: Signed <: Integer <: Real <: Number <: Any`

> `Function <: Any`

Note the notation `<:` to denote: *is a subtype of*

- **Every** julia object belongs in a typetree. 
- **Every** julia object is a subtype of `Any`. 

### Concrete vs abstract types

- Notice that one can have an explicit instantation of *Homo sapiens*. For instance, me. *Homo sapiens* is a species. 
- One **can't** have an explicit instantiation of e.g. Mammalia, that is not also something more specific. There is no creature that is just a mammal, and not a concrete species as well.

- All julia objects belong to a **concrete** type (also called a struct). You can build explicit instantiations of concrete types. They are like species.

- Other julia objects are called **abstract types**. You can't have an explicit instantation of an abstract type. In the same way that you can't have an animal that is just a mammal, and not also a member of a more specific species. But concrete types (e.g. Homo sapiens) can be subtypes of abstract types (e.g. mammal).

- Types themselves have a type: `DataType`. Explore for yourself!

**Extension**: instead, below we create a `double-like` function that returns the 	cartesian product (set of ordered pairs) of a set with itself.  This highlights 	another property of a set: because sets are unordered, we have to consider all 		combinations of pairs.
- **Doubling a string**: This is because the order of concatenation matters: ```"hello " + "world"``` is not the same as ```"world" + "hello "```.  Thus, concatenation is not commutative.  The ```+``` symbol is usually reserved for commutative operations.

2. Since $f : X \to Y$ is not injective, $\exists x_1,x_2 : (x_1 \neq x_2) \land (f(x_1) = f(x_2))$.  If a left-inverse existed, $f(x_1) = f(x_2) \implies f^{-1}(f(x_1)) = f^{-1}(f(x_2)) \implies x_1 = x_2$.  This is a contradiction, so no left-inverse can exist.
3. Suppose the right inverse $f^{-1} : Y \to X$ exists.  Since $f : X \to Y$ is not surjective, $\exists y\in Y : \forall x \in X, f(x) \neq y$.  Thus, $Y$ cannot be the domain of $f^{-1}$, since $f^{-1}(y)$ is undefined.  This is a contradiction, and so the right-inverse cannot exist.
4. Since $f$ is bijective, $\forall y,\, \exists!x : f(x) = y$.  Therefore we can construct a function $f^{-1} :Y \to X$ such that $\forall y, \exists!x : f^{-1}(y) = x$.  This function is not one-to-many due to objectivity.

# Number systems, definitions, and axioms

Mathematics is black and white. Things are true or false ([*most of the time!*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_excluded_middle#In_mathematical_logic)).

Did you ever play the game as a kid when you ask: "why?" to everything? Something like this:

**Stage 1**

	Adult: *Interesting statement*
	Child: *Why?*

**Stage 2**

```
for i = 1:boredom
	Adult: *Answers the 'why'*
	Child: *why?*
end
```


When we prove a statement in mathematics, we have to start from some **axioms**: statements which we take to be self-evident, and require no evidence or proof. You have to start from somewhere! Anything you then prove mathematically, depends on its axioms.

!!! info "Example"
	If we decided that $x \div 0 = x$, instead of being undefined, then lots of mathematical proofs would break! They **require** this axiom.

As such, mathematics has the concept of an **axiomatic definition**. We will demonstrate by example below:

Let $S$ be a number system. Then the following axioms hold.

Lots of things here! But most of them you use subconsciously. Note that we have defined $0$ and $1$ based on **how they interact** with other elements of the number system. Not **what they are**.

We can use modular arithmetic to define fields over each of the sets above.  The fields in question correspond, respectively to the *finite fields* $\mathbb{F}_2, \mathbb{F}_5, \mathbb{F}_7$.
	
For natural number $n\in \mathbb{N}$, we define modular addition as follows:
	
```math
	\newcommand{\Mod}[1]{\ (\mathrm{mod}\ #1)}
	
	\begin{align}
	(a + b) \Mod n &= (a \Mod n + b \Mod n) \Mod n \\
	(a \times b) \Mod n &= (a \Mod n \times b \Mod n) \Mod n \\
	\end{align}
```
	
The following properties hold:
	
- 0 and 1 are still the additive/multiplicative identity, respectively.
- Commutativity can be demonstrated by noting the symmetry of the multiplication tables.
- The additive inverse of $a$ is $n - a$.  For the multiplicative inverses, this can be demonstrated by either (1) forming multiplication tables for the non-zero elements of the sets, and seeing that there is a 1 is every row and column, or (2) using Euclid's algorithm.
	
Note: the existence of multiplicative inverses relies on the fact that $n$ is prime!  For $n=4$, for instance, one can show that 2 has no inverse.

$\mathbb{F}_p$ is the set consisting of $\{0, 1,2, 3, \dots, p-1\}$, where $p$ is a prime number. It is always a field, as long as $p$ is prime. If you'd like a challenge, prove that such sets are always field! (You'll need Euclid's algorithm, which you could also try and prove)
